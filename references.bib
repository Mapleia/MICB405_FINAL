  abstract = {To better understand heavy metal tolerance in Chlamydomonas acidophila, an extremophilic green alga, we assembled its transcriptome and measured transcriptomic expression before and after Cd exposure in this and the neutrophilic model microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. Genes possibly related to heavy metal tolerance and detoxification were identified and analyzed as potential key innovations that enable this species to live in an extremely acid habitat with high levels of heavy metals. In addition we provide a data set of single orthologous genes from eight green algal species as a valuable resource for comparative studies including eukaryotic extremophiles. Our results based on differential gene expression, detection of unique genes and analyses of codon usage all indicate that there are important genetic differences in C. acidophila compared to C. reinhardtii. Several efflux family proteins were identified as candidate key genes for adaptation to acid environments. This study suggests for the first time that exposure to cadmium strongly increases transposon expression in green algae, and that oil biosynthesis genes are induced in Chlamydomonas under heavy metal stress. Finally, the comparison of the transcriptomes of several acidophilic and non-acidophilic algae showed that the Chlamydomonas genus is polyphyletic and that acidophilic algae have distinctive aminoacid usage patterns.},

  abstract     = {Water quality degradation is a worldwide problem, but risk evaluation of chronic pollution in-situ is still a challenge. The present study aimed to evaluate the potential of transcriptomic analyses in representative aquatic primary producers to assess the impact of environmental pollution in-situ: the microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and the macrophyte Elodea nuttallii were exposed 2 h in the Babeni Reservoir of the Olt River impacted by chlor-alkali plant effluent release resulting in increased concentrations of Hg and NaCl in receiving water. The response at the transcriptomic level was strong, resulting in up to 5485, and 8700 dysregulated genes (DG) for the microalga and for the macrophyte exposed in the most contaminated site, respectively. Transcriptomic response was congruent with the concentrations of Hg and NaCl in the water of the impacted reservoir. Genes involved in development, energy metabolism, lipid metabolism, nutrition, and RedOx homeostasis were dysregulated during in-situ exposure of both organisms. In addition, genes involved in the cell motility of C. reinhardtii and development of the cell wall of E. nuttallii were affected. DG were in line with adverse outcome pathways and transcriptomic studies reported after exposure to high concentrations of Hg and NaCl under controlled conditions in the laboratory. Transcriptomic response provided a sensitive measurement of the exposure as well as hints on the tolerance mechanisms of environmental pollution, and is thus promising as an early-warning tool to assess water quality degradation.},

In order to better understand the environmental risks of the rare earth elements (REEs), it is necessary to determine their fate and biological effects under environmentally relevant conditions (e.g. at low concentrations, REE mixtures). Here, the unicellular freshwater microalga, Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, was exposed for 2 h to one of three soluble REEs (Ce, Tm, Y) salts at 0.5 μM or to an equimolar mixture of these REEs. RNA sequencing revealed common biological effects among the REEs. Known functions of the differentially expressed genes support effects of REEs on protein processing in the endoplasmic reticulum, phosphate transport and the homeostasis of Fe and Ca. The only stress response detected was related to protein misfolding in the endoplasmic reticulum. When the REEs were applied as a mixture, antagonistic effects were overwhelmingly observed with transcriptomic results suggesting that the REEs were initially competing with each other for bio-uptake. Metal biouptake results were consistent with this interpretation. These results suggest that the approach of government agencies to regulate the REEs using biological effects data from single metal exposures may be a largely conservative approach.},

  abstract = {{Increasing industrial and anthropogenic activities are producing and releasing more and more pollutants in the environment. Among them, toxic metals are one of the major threats for human health and natural ecosystems. Because photosynthetic organisms play a critical role in primary productivity and pollution management, investigating their response to metal toxicity is of major interest. Here, the green microalga Chlamydomonas (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii) was subjected to short (3 d) or chronic (6 months) exposure to 50 µM cadmium (Cd), and the recovery from chronic exposure was also examined. An extensive phenotypic characterization and transcriptomic analysis showed that the impact of Cd on biomass production of short-term (ST) exposed cells was almost entirely abolished by long-term (LT) acclimation. The underlying mechanisms were initiated at ST and further amplified after LT exposure resulting in a reversible equilibrium allowing biomass production similar to control condition. This included modification of cell wall-related gene expression and biofilm-like structure formation, dynamics of metal ion uptake and homeostasis, photosynthesis efficiency recovery and Cd acclimation through metal homeostasis adjustment. The contribution of the identified coordination of phosphorus and iron homeostasis (partly) mediated by the main phosphorus homeostasis regulator, Phosphate Starvation Response 1, and a basic Helix-Loop-Helix transcription factor (Cre05.g241636) was further investigated. The study reveals the highly dynamic physiological plasticity enabling algal cell growth in an extreme environment.}},
